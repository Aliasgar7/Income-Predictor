Dataset: Adult Census income binary Classification dataset

Aim: To predict income based on various personal factors .

Algorithm:  Two-Class Bayes Point Machine

The business faces problems in determining the correct income that an employee deserves. The system is so designed that it helps to estimate the salary, so it helps the business to give the correct amount of salary to their employees nor the company will face the issue of giving more salary then required, and thus saving the total expenditure.
The methodology which we followed was that we took the dataset of incomes. Out of all the columns we selected the columns which had a major impact in determining the income. These were age,workclass,education,occupation,hours-per-week,native-country,income,sex and race. Then we split the dataset into training and testing data in the ratio 0.75 : 0.25. We used Two-Class Bayes Point Machine to create a model that will classify if the income is greater than 50k or less based on the values of the above columns.
